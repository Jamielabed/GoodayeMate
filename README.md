# GoodayeMate - Australian Chatbot

GoodayeMate is a chatbot application with a strong Australian personality. It uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5 to generate conversational responses and converts them to audio using Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS). The backend is built with FastAPI, and the frontend is built with Angular. There are instructures for running with Docker and deploying with
Kubernetes.

The pupose of this app was to create a basic AI chatbot and teach myself how to create
a docker image and deploy to a k8s cluster. Enjoy!

## Features
